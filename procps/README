procps-3.0.5 download from procps.sourceforge.net/index.html

The latest version is 3.2.8+, but have some problems compile the 
latest version in my computer(ubuntu 10.04).
Download the 3.0.5(had replace <asm/param.h> to <ams/page.h>).
This version can compile and run in ubuntu 10.04 just like:
	$make
	$make install
	or
	$make
	$sudo mv proc/libproc.so.3.0.5 /usr/lib
	$./top #and something else not install

solve the problem to run just like (./ping) etc program need to 
use (sudo or su) to root.
	In the path of the program exist, use the command like:
	$chown root ping
	$chmod u+s ping
	(XXX: may be have security problem when the program is 
		a virus or have some malicious code)
